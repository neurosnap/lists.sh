# Need help?
Here are some common questions on using this platform that we would like to answer.

## Generating a new SSH key

=> https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent Github reference

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.
* At the prompt, type a secure passphrase.

## What should my blog folder look like?

Currently {{.Site.Domain}} only supports a flat folder structure.  Therefore, `scp -r` is not permitted.  We also only allow `.txt` files to be uploaded.

=> https://github.com/neurosnap/lists-blog Here is the source to my blog on this platform

Below is an example of what your blog folder should look like:
```
blog/
  first-post.txt
  second-post.txt
  third-post.txt
```

Underscores and hyphens are permitted and will be automatically removed from the title of the list.

## How do I update a list?

Updating a list requires that you update the source document and then run the `scp` command again.  If the filename remains the same, then the list will be updated.

## How do I delete a list?

Because `scp` does not natively support deleting files, I didn't want to bake that behavior into my ssh server.

However, if a user wants to delete a post they can delete the contents of the file and then upload it to our server.  If the file contains 0 bytes, we will remove the post. For example, if you want to delete `delete.txt` you could:

```
cp /dev/null delete.txt
scp ./delete.txt {{.Site.Domain}}:/
```

Alternatively, you can go to `ssh {{.Site.Domain}}` and select "Manage posts." Then you can highlight the post you want to delete and then press "X."  It will ask for confirmation before actually removing the list.

## When I want to publish a new post, do I have to upload all posts everytime?

Nope!  Just `scp` the file you want to publish.  For example, if you created a new post called `taco-tuesday.txt` then you would publish it like this:

```
scp ./taco-tuesday.txt {{.Site.Domain}}:/
```

## How do I change my blog's name?

All you have to do is create a post titled `_header.txt` and add some information to the list.
```
=: title My new blog!
=: description My blog description!
=> https://xyz.com website
=> https://twitter.com/xyz twitter
```

* `title` will change your blog name
* `description` will add a blurb right under your blog name (and add meta descriptions)
* The links will show up next to the `rss` link to your blog

## How do I add an introduction to my blog?

All you have to do is create a post titled `_readme.txt` and add some information to the list.

```
=: list_type none
# Hi my name is Bob!
I like to sing. Dance. And I like to have fun fun fun!
```

Whatever is inside the `_readme` file will get rendered (as a list) right above your blog posts. Neat!

## What is my blog URL?

```
gemini://{{.Site.Domain}}/{username}
```

## How can I automatically publish my post?

There is a github action that we built to make it easy to publish your blog automatically.

=> https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lists-publish-action github marketplace
=> https://github.com/neurosnap/lists-official-blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml example workflow

A user also created a systemd task to automatically publish new posts.
