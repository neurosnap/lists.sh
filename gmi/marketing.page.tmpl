# {{.Site.Domain}}
A microblog for lists

=> /read discover some interesting lists

---

## Examples

=> /erock blog
=> /erock/knowledge-management-apps list
=> https://github.com/neurosnap/lists-blog blog source
=> /news official blog

## Create your account

We don't want your email address.

To get started, simply ssh into our content management system:

```
ssh new@{{.Site.Domain}}
```

After that, just set a username and you're ready to start writing!  When you SSH again, use your username that you set in the CMS.

## You control the source files

Create lists using your favorite editor in plain text files.

`~/blog/days-in-week.txt`

```
Sunday
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
```

## Publish your posts with one command

When your post is ready to be published, copy the file to our server with a familiar command:

```
scp ~/blog/*.txt {{.Site.Domain}}
```

note: if using openssh v9+, also supply the `-O` flag.
We'll either create or update the lists for you.

## Terminal workflow without installation

Since we are leveraging tools you already have on your computer (`ssh` and `scp`), there is nothing to install. This provides the convenience of a web app, but from inside your terminal!

## Plain text format

A simple specification that is flexible and with no frills.

## Philosophy

I love writing lists.  I think restricting writing to a set of lists can really help improve clarity in thought.  The goal of this blogging platform is to make it simple to use the tools you love to write and publish lists.  There is no installation, signup is as easy as SSH'ing into our CMS, and publishing content is as easy as copying files to our server.

Another goal of this microblog platform is to satisfy my own needs.  I like to write and share lists with people because I find it's one of the best way to disseminate knowledge.  Whether it's a list of links or a list of paragraphs, writing in lists is very satisfying and I welcome you to explore it on this site!

Other blogging platforms support writing lists, but they don't emphasize them.  Writing lists is pretty popular on Twitter, but discoverability is terrible.  Other blogging platforms focus on prose, but there really is nothing out there catered specifically for lists ... until now.

## Roadmap

* Support `text/plain` as a content-type for web server
